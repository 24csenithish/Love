## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Will the music autoplay?**
A: On desktop yes. On mobile, she needs to tap the page first (browsers require user interaction for sound).

**Q: Can I change what name appears?**
A: Yes! Find "Gayu" in the HTML and replace with her name. Find [Your Name] and put your name.

**Q: Where do I put the music file?**
A: Same folder as index.html. It should be named `romantic-music.mp3` unless you change the HTML reference.

**Q: Where do I put photos?**
A: Same folder as index.html. Update the filenames in the HTML photo section.

**Q: Can I add more than 3 photos?**
A: Yes! Copy a photo-item div and adjust the animation delay in CSS.

**Q: What if I don't have photos?**
A: The colorful gradients will display beautifully as placeholders - she'll love the experience regardless!

**Q: Can I change the text/quotes?**
A: Absolutely! Everything is customizable. Open HTML and edit any text you see.

**Q: Will it work on her old smartphone?**
A: Yes! The site is optimized for all devices. Even older phones will display it beautifully.

**Q: What if the link doesn't work?**
A: Make sure:
1. All files are uploaded correctly
2. File names match exactly (case-sensitive on some servers)
3. Wait 1-2 minutes after uploading
4. Clear browser cache and try again

**Q: Can I re-send the link after she sees it?**
A: Yes! The link will always work. She can revisit it anytime.

**Q: Can people other than her access the link?**
A: Yes, anyone with the link can see it. Keep it private by only sharing with her. For extra privacy, you could upload to a password-protected site, but a unique URL is usually sufficient.
